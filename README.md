## Phishing Awareness

Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, by disguising as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications.

### Key Differences Between Legitimate and Phishing Websites:

- **URL**: Always check the URL for misspellings or unusual domain names.
- **HTTPS**: Legitimate sites use HTTPS; however, some phishing sites may also use HTTPS.
- **Design**: Phishing sites often have slight design inconsistencies compared to the legitimate version.
- **Security Features**: Legitimate websites often have additional security features like two-factor authentication.
